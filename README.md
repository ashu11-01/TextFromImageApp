# TextFromImageApp
This app recoginizes text from an image captured by camera as well as from an existing image. The recognized text can be modified, saved in form of a note or even be shared with others. The app is completely written in Kotlin programming language. It was developed during the Google's 30 Days of Kotlin campaign organized during 7th May 2020 to 7th June 2020.

## Libraries Used
To recognize text from an image, Google ML Kit's [Text Recognition API](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/text-recognition) is used. To save the recognized text as a note [Room Persistence Library](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/text-recognition) is used.
